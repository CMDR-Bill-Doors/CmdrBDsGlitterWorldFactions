  <Hediff_3HSTHeavyArmor.description>The 3HST heavy infantry support armor sacrifices everything for combat. It'll increase your reload speed and your weapon handling, and helps you aim better, but at the cost of slowing you down. More over, the armor is not designed to do anything except combat, so you'll have a difficult time working while wearing it.</Hediff_3HSTHeavyArmor.description>
